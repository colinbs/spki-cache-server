SPKI Cache Server
-----------------

Server For Distributing Router Keys
-----------------------------------
This tool provides a minimalistic server that accepts RTR connections and
sends router keys to connected routers.

A typical PDU exchange can be found within the RFC specification
[here](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8210.html#section-8.1).

In detail, the tool does the following:

1. server listens for incoming connections
2. upon connection, server sends _cache response_ PDU
3. server sends all _router key_ PDUs
4. server sends _end of data_ PDU with maximum retry time value (2 hours)
5. server closes connection and starts listening again

Script For Generating Valid Router Keys
---------------------------------------
This Repository provides a way of generating router keys which can be used
with the server. The router keys can be generated by executing the following
command

    ./gen-keys AMOUNT DIR

Keep in mind that the `keys/` directory must already exist. See the
[Examples](#Examples) for more.

Usage of Server
---------------
The server is started by specifying a _host address_, a _port_ and
one of two _router key options_ (see [Examples](#Examples)).

Router keys must either already exist or can be generated by the server on
startup. **Important**: router keys generated by this tool are dummy router keys
are by no means valid! They should not be used for anything else but testing!

To start the server with existing router keys, simply point to the
directory storing the router keys with the `--keypath PATH` option

    ./cache.py HOST PORT --keypath PATH

To generate dummy router keys by the server, use the `-d AMOUNT` option

    ./cache.py HOST PORT -d AMOUNT

Examples
--------

To generate 100 router keys in the `keys/` directory, run

    ./gen-keys 100 keys/

Start a server on `0.0.0.0:8383` with existing router keys

    ./cache.py 0.0.0.0 8383 --keypath path/to/keys

Start a server on `0.0.0.0:8383` and generate 100 dummy router keys

    ./cache.py 0.0.0.0 8383 -d 100
