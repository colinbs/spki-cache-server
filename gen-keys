# This script here generates an arbitrary amount of router keys.
# These router keys are x509 certificates generated with openssl.
# By default, the resulting router keys are named by their index
# count during generation. I.e. generating five certificats will result
# in certificates named 1.cert to 5.cert. If a certificate already
# exists, the index is incremented and generation is retried until
# the filename is free to take.
# For certificate generation, the key.conf file is required. Changing
# its contents is not recommended as it could lead to invalid
# certificates.
